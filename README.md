# Yin-Yang
This is a repository holding the source code to my first full fledged Windows game, Yin Yang.
The src folder holds all source code that the game uses. This is the working copy that I used in class to create the game.
The exe folder holds all of the files necessary to run the executable.
The stand-alone exe file is a single SFX file that runs the game without the exe folder!
